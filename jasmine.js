// let's say that we want to change the color of the newly applied group
// we search for all color in that group
// then we select each of them to change them

// let's say that we want to change the font-size of the newly applied group
// we search for all font-size in that group
// then we select each of them to change them

// let's say that we want to change the font-family of the newly applied group
// we search for all font-family in that group
// then we select each of them to change them

// so this panel should be called 'scope'

// after we scoped the newly applied group, we can show all types if we want to, then select and change them all
// in the same panel
// we can quickly jump to our desired type with the numpad, or we can just use regular arrows to navigate

// let's have a quick recap
// we can steal shit
// we can process what we stole
// we can save what we've processed
// we can load what we've saved
// we can change content & customize what we've loaded
// then we just need to export our finished re-creation
